# AWS re:Invent 2024


Las Vegas
---------

From the 2nd of December to the 6th. Las Vegas transformed into the ultimate hub for the global cloud computing community — it was AWS’s flagship annual conference: **reInvent.** Packed with inspiring keynotes, in-depth technical sessions, exciting product launches, and endless networking opportunities.

**Keynote Sessions**
--------------------

A **keynote session** is one of the most important and highly anticipated parts of any major conference, including AWS re:Invent. It’s a spotlight moment where influential leaders, visionaries, or experts in a field share big-picture ideas, groundbreaking announcements, and insights to set the tone for the event.

At AWS re:Invent, keynote sessions often feature high-level executives, who unveil major cloud innovations, new services, and the company’s future vision. These sessions provide attendees with a broad understanding of emerging trends in cloud computing and AWS’s strategy for staying at the forefront of the industry.

Think of a keynote session as the main stage performance at a music festival: it’s where the spotlight shines brightest, the crowd gathers, and the most exciting revelations happen!

### **SVP, Utility Computing, AWS**

Monday Night Live with Peter DeSantis
-------------------------------------

### **Keynote Creativity with AI**

Peter DeSantis used an AI assistant to make his keynote more engaging by generating numerous analogies, allowing him to choose the most fitting one. This introduction emphasized the benefits of GenAI, encouraging attendees to embrace AI collaboration without feeling diminished. The key message: **_AI is here to stay, so leverage it while you can._**

DeSantis ultimately chose the analogy “Below the Surface,” which uses trees and their roots to represent his theme. Interestingly, not all trees have taproots, a fact he tied into AWS’s ability to innovate across stacks. He drew comparisons between the interconnectedness of roots and AWS’s innovation ecosystem, particularly the Nitro system.

### **Enter David Brown**

**VP of Compute and Networking at AWS**

David Brown took the stage, beginning with a nod to the birth of EC2 in Cape Town — something I think he has mentioned this before at the Johannesburg Summit, and he should always mention it, because South Africa is awesome.

Brown discussed:

**Custom Silicon Development**: The journey began with Graviton in 2018, leading to Graviton 2, Graviton 3, and now **Graviton 4**, introduced in 2023. Graviton 4 is the most powerful chip yet, purpose-built for high-performance computing.

**Graviton Optimization**: Most services perform significantly better when powered by Graviton.

**The AWS Nitro System**: Nitro enhances server architecture, enabling features like running macOS on the cloud, improving security, and ensuring hardware integrity. Nitro solves problems that traditional on-premises data centers can’t address.

**Hello Barge, Bye Barge:** Brown highlighted AWS’s constant innovation in storage systems, referencing **_Barge_**_,_ an ambitious attempt to push storage density boundaries. Despite its potential, AWS learned valuable lessons and moved on from Barge, focusing on building more resilient servers with reduced blast radius impacts.

### **The Return of Peter DeSantis**

DeSantis returned to discuss **AI workloads**, describing them as a “scale-up” rather than a “scale-out” system due to the increasing size and capability of models.

Highlights included:

**Data Parallelism**: He explained how it optimizes AI training.

**Trainium 2 Chip**: DeSantis showcased the micro-level design of Trainium 2, including a live demonstration of the Trainium 2 server, a powerful infrastructure designed to meet customer demands for advanced AI workloads.

### **Guest Spotlight**

**Tom Brown, Co-Founder and Chief Compute Officer of Anthropic**
Tom Brown introduced **Claude**, Anthropic’s AI model, and discussed its latest iteration, **Claude 3.5 Haiku**. He highlighted its smaller size, reduced costs, and compatibility with Trainium 2, reinforcing the message that **_AI is the way forward_**_._

**Announcements from Peter DeSantis’s Keynote**
-----------------------------------------------

1.  Latency-Optimized Inference Option for Amazon Bedrock
2.  Anthropic Claude 3.5 Haiku

_AWS continues to innovate at every level, from silicon to AI infrastructure, ensuring a future-ready cloud ecosystem._

### **VP and CTO, Amazon.com**

Dr. Werner Vogels Keynote
-------------------------

As the saying goes, _“Save the best for last,”_ sung by Vanessa Williams, Dr. Werner Vogels closed with his signature blend of storytelling and wisdom. The theme of his keynote?

**Simplexity** — the delicate balance between simplicity and complexity in system design.

Dr. Vogels emphasized core principles:

### **Build for the customer, build for the business**

Building for the customer and the business requires striking a balance between meeting user needs and aligning with long-term organizational goals.

### **Plan for failure**

In a cloud-native world, failure is not an “if” but a “when.” Planning for failure means designing systems that expect and gracefully handle errors.

### **Keep it simple (stupid)**

The KISS principle emphasizes that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. In cloud computing, simplicity minimizes errors, reduces maintenance costs, and enhances scalability.

### The distinction between **intended** vs. **unintended complexity**

Understanding the nature of complexity in your systems is key to managing it effectively.

### Enter Brendan Humphreys

**CTO of Canva**

Brendan, with his captivating voice, shared Canva’s journey of evolution and its growing need for scalability. His insights on scaling resonated deeply with the theme of managing complexity in the business while maintaining simplicity for the customer.

### The Return of Dr. Vogels

Dr. Vogels reminded the audience that **evolution is fundamental and change is constant.** He explained that achieving simplicity demands discipline and unveiled his **Six Lessons to Prevent Complexity:**

### **1. Make Evolvability a Requirement**

Your systems will grow over time. Design them to evolve in a controllable manner, accommodating future changes with ease. As Vogels put it, “A system’s ability to easily accommodate future change is key.”

### **2. Break Complexity into Pieces**

Avoid ignoring warning signs. Decompose problems into manageable parts to maintain clarity.

### **3. Align Your Organization to Your Architecture**

Structure teams in a way that mirrors your system’s architecture to streamline communication and decision-making.

### **4. Organize into Cells**

Create autonomous, self-sufficient units to foster flexibility and resilience.

### **5. Design Predictable Systems**

Ensure systems behave consistently, even under stress. Predictability reduces unintended surprises.

### **6. Automate Complexity**

Use automation to handle complex tasks, minimizing human error and saving time.

_This approach might just be the_ [**_future of human intelligence_**](https://medium.com/computational-thinking-aad778141895)_, echoing principles of classic computational thinking. The keynote left the audience reflecting on the beauty of simplicity in a complex world._
