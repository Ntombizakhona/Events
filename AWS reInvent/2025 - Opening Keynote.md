AWS ReInvent 2025 Keynotes
--------------------------

Opening Keynote
===============

Matt Garman, AWS CEO
--------------------


Oh… whatever happened to Monday Night Live?

Anyways.

Since the theme of the introduction was “**Why not?**”, I guess… _why not_ switch it up a bit?

> “Everything starts with the customer.” — Matt Garman

As an AWS customer, I was really hoping to hear more about the latest innovations in Agentic AI. There’s so much happening there right now, and I was ready for a deep dive.

### AWS AI Factories

Matt mentioned **AWS AI Factories**, a new service where you can integrate AWS-managed AI infrastructure with your existing hardware or on‑premises data center. AWS will manage it for you, and it will be operated exclusively for each customer.

That rack of ultraservers they showed was _beautiful_. I genuinely want one of those in my office.

### Amazon Nova and Nova Forge

So anyway, the keynote itself was… uhm, you know, uhm…_no words._

Besides **Amazon Nova 2**, another cool announcement was **Amazon Nova Forge**. This service will allow you to blend proprietary data into your models, giving you more control and customization over how your own data powers AI.

### Sony, Kando, and Customer Experience

Then came the Sony guy, Mr. John Kodera, who emphasized the principle behind a Japanese term called **Kando:** that feeling of deep emotional satisfaction or excitement that goes beyond expectations. It was an interesting angle on how technology can create emotional impact, not just utility.

### Agentic AI, AgentCore, and Policies

> “Agents are exciting.” — Matt Garman

I completely agree, and I was hoping for even more agentic stuff.

Matt touched on **AgentCore** and announced _Policy in AgentCore_ and _AgentCore Evaluations_. We’ll probably have to go hunt down the documentation, read up on it, and try implementing it to really understand the power there, but it definitely sounds cool and foundational for building safer, governed agents.

### Adobe Segment

Then there was the Adobe guy. Not gonna lie, I don’t know much about Adobe beyond PDFs, so most of that segment didn’t land as strongly for me. Still, it fit the overall theme of Creative + generative AI… and agents.

### Kiro and Autonomous Agents

Matt came back and talked about **Kiro**, introducing three new features:

1.  **Autonomous Agents for Kiro**: This was the part that really caught my attention. The idea of having agents that can act more independently on your behalf is super exciting.
2.  **AWS Security Agent:** Apparently this embeds security upstream, helping to catch and mitigate issues earlier in the development or deployment process.
3.  **DevOps Agent:** This one _might_ replace some of the work DevOps engineers do, or at least massively amplify their productivity. Hard to say yet, but it’s definitely something DevOps teams will want to watch closely.

### The 10-Minute Lightning Round

25 New Announcements
--------------------

Then Matt had about 10 minutes to announce what felt like 25 new services and features. He absolutely sped through them. I’m hoping these will be covered in more detail during re:Caps, because it was a lot.

Here’s what I captured:

### New Compute & Instance Types

**1.** x8i instances

**2.** x8aedz instances

**3.** c8a instances

**4**. c8ine instances

**5.** m8azn instances

**6.** EC2 M3 Ultra

**7.** EC2 M4 Max

### Serverless & Storage

**8**. Lambda Durable Functions
**9.** S3 object size limit increased to **50 TB**
**10**. S3 Batch Operations **10x faster**
**11**. Intelligent tiering for S3 tables
**12**. Automatic S3 table replication
**13**. S3 Access Points for FSx for NetApp ONTAP
**14**. S3 Vectors

### Analytics & Search

**15**. GPU acceleration on OpenSearch
**16**. EMR Serverless with no storage provisioning required

### Security & Monitoring

**17**. GuardDuty threat detection for ECS
**18**. GuardDuty threat detection for EC2
**19**. Security Hub updates generally available
**20**. Unified data store in CloudWatch

### Databases & Cost Optimization

**21**. More storage for RDS for SQL Server
**22**. More storage for RDS for Oracle
**23**. Optimized CPUs for RDS for SQL Server
**24**. RDS for SQL Server Edition
**25**. Database Savings Plans

_I hope I captured those accurately, because it really was a rapid-fire segment._

Concluding Remarks
------------------

And that was… the _opening keynote._

I honestly can’t wait to dive into [**Kiro Autonomous Agents.**](https://kiro.dev/blog/introducing-kiro-autonomous-agent/)

The whole agentic AI direction sounds amazing, and I’m really looking forward to experimenting with it and seeing how far we can push these new capabilities.
