# Tech Events & Cons

This blog is my running log of tech events, conferences (“cons”), meetups, and community gatherings I attend—or plan to attend. It’s where I capture what stood out, what I learned, and what I think is worth remembering (or rethinking) after the hype fades.

## Why This Exists

Tech moves fast, but most real value comes from:
- the people you meet
- the ideas you hear *in context*
- the notes you take and revisit later
- the questions you leave with

This space helps me turn events into long-term learning instead of one-time inspiration.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Event recaps:** key takeaways, favorite sessions, and honest reflections  
- **Talk notes:** concepts, tools, quotes, and references I want to follow up on  
- **Trends & opinions:** what I think is signal vs. noise  
- **Community highlights:** people/projects that deserve attention  
- **Practical learnings:** career lessons, networking tips, and what I’d do differently next time  

## What This Is (and Isn’t)

- This is **my perspective**, not official event coverage.
- I’m not trying to summarize everything—I’m capturing what mattered to *me*.
- If I change my mind after trying something in real life, I’ll say so.

## Join In

If you’re attending the same events:
- share your notes and takeaways
- recommend talks I should watch
- suggest communities and meetups worth exploring

I’m always open to learning in public and learning with others.

**Tech events are temporary. Good notes compound.**
