AWS Partner Summit
==================

Johannesburg
------------

The **AWS Partner Summit Johannesburg 2025** was nothing short of remarkable. Compared to last year, the scale of the event was striking: a much bigger crowd, more partners in attendance, and an undeniable sense of momentum within the South African and African cloud ecosystem.

Back in **2023**, the Summit was humbly held at the **conference center of Houghton Hotel,** a solid but intimate venue that reflected the growing, yet still modest, partner community at the time. Fast forward just two years, and the difference couldn’t be more visible.

The **2025 Summit drew a significantly larger audience**, showing just how much AWS and its partners have grown in both presence and impact.

And if this year is any indication, it wouldn’t be surprising to see the **2026 Summit expand even further, possibly taking up even more floors at the Sandton Convention Centre**.

_The trajectory is clear: bigger venues, bigger conversations, and bigger opportunities._

Bigger, Bolder, Busier
----------------------

Walking into the venue, it was immediately clear that this year’s Summit had grown in both size and ambition. The Keynote Session was packed, the networking area was busy and buzzing, and the overall energy highlighted just how much AWS is investing in Africa’s cloud journey.

Key Themes
----------

Several important themes stood out:

### **Partner Enablement at Scale**

AWS highlighted the importance of enabling partners with tools, training, and programs to serve customers more effectively.

### **Local Skills Development**

Once again, skills took center stage. Initiatives like the AWS Skills Center in Cape Town and the use of Skill Builder were emphasized as critical for empowering the workforce.

### **SMB Growth**

There was a strong focus on how small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) can leverage AWS to scale efficiently, reduce costs, and innovate faster.

### AI in Action

From demonstrations of **AI Services on AWS** to the role of emerging standards, the event showed how AWS and its partners are shaping the future of cloud adoption in Africa.

The Human Element
-----------------

While the technology was impressive, what stood out most was the **community of people…**partners learning from one another, exchanging ideas, and sharing success stories. The conversations extended beyond business to impact: how cloud can support education, entrepreneurship, and inclusion across South Africa and beyond.
