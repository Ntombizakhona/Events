# AWS Partner Summit

Johannesburg
------------

I had the opportunity to attend the AWS Partner Summit in Johannesburg. For those who might not know, the AWS Partner Network (APN) is essentially Amazon’s program for businesses and organizations that build solutions or provide services using AWS. Think of AWS partners as collaborators who innovate and deliver value to customers worldwide using AWS technologies.

Empowering Partnerships and Women in Tech
-----------------------------------------

This event was an engaging experience, filled with insightful discussions, networking opportunities, and a clear focus on empowering both partners and women in STEM. Oh, and did I mention the theme? Pink! A bold, vibrant choice to emphasize the need for more women in the cloud and tech industries, and it was held in August, which is considered ‘Women’s Month’ in South Africa, as ‘Women’s Day’ is on the 9th of August.

What Is an AWS Partner?
-----------------------

An AWS Partner is any organization that works alongside AWS to create cloud-based solutions for customers. Partners can range from startups and independent consultants to large enterprises. They fall into two main categories:

1.  **Technology Partners:** They provide software solutions built on AWS.
2.  **Consulting Partners:** They offer guidance, implementation, and management services for AWS solutions.

Why Become an AWS Partner?
--------------------------

Being an AWS Partner comes with several benefits:

### **Access to Resources**

AWS provides training, technical support, and marketing tools to help partners succeed.

### **Innovation Opportunities**

Partners can leverage cutting-edge AWS technologies to build solutions.

### **Networking and Collaboration**

As a partner, you gain access to a global community of cloud experts and businesses.

### **Credibility**

The AWS Partner badge boosts your reputation, showing customers that you’re trusted by a global leader in cloud computing.

### **Customer Trust**

Being part of the network reassures clients that your solutions meet high standards of quality and security.

Women in Tech: Breaking Barriers
--------------------------------

A significant highlight of the summit was the focus on women in STEM and cloud computing. It was refreshing to see AWS using its platform to encourage more women to step into the tech industry.

The emphasis on pink was more than just a theme, it was a call to action. The tech industry has long been male-dominated, but events like this are actively working to change that.

During the summit, there were panels featuring inspiring women leaders who shared their journeys, the challenges they faced, and the opportunities that await young women in tech. It was empowering to see the emphasis on inclusivity, innovation, and the value of diverse perspectives in shaping the future of cloud computing.

The Event Itself
----------------

The summit was packed, and the energy in the room was infectious. It was clear that AWS is deeply invested in building a strong partner ecosystem in Africa. With sessions covering everything from cloud optimization to distribution, I walked away with a notebook _(an actual pink notebook!)_ full of ideas and a renewed sense of excitement for the future of tech on the continent.

Networking was another highlight. I met entrepreneurs, cloud architects, and business leaders, all with unique stories about how they’re leveraging AWS to transform industries. It was also encouraging to see so many young women attending, visibly inspired by the theme and the representation on stage.

**The Food?** The food was good.

Concluding Remarks
------------------

The AWS Partner Summit Johannesburg wasn’t just an event, it was a celebration of collaboration, growth, and inclusivity. AWS is clearly investing in Africa’s tech future, and the focus on empowering women is a crucial step in ensuring this growth is sustainable and equitable.

Here’s to more events like this, where the themes are bold, the opportunities are vast, and the message is clear: **There’s room for everyone in the cloud.**
