# AWS Summit 
## Johannesburg
------------

The **AWS Summit Johannesburg** hosted at the Sandton Convention Centre was an unforgettable experience, and not just because of the incredible turnout (seriously, it was _packed,_ **_apparently there were over 10 000 attendees_**_!_). It was a melting pot of innovation, collaboration, and community, bringing together not just South Africans but Africans from across the diaspora. It felt like the tech world’s version of a family reunion, one where everyone is showcasing the coolest gadgets, cutting-edge ideas, and game-changing solutions.

Walking into the event, the energy was palpable. Every corner buzzed with discussions on the latest cloud technologies, success stories, and pathways to digital transformation. I attended sessions that were eye-opening, from deep dives into generative AI to hands-on workshops on serverless computing. The speakers shared insights that made me rethink how we can approach cloud solutions across industries in Africa, particularly the public transport industry in South Africa.

But let me keep it real, there were _so many_ people that, at one point, I found myself weaving through crowds, and there were queues and queues of excited people. I decided to momentarily sneak out, shop a little, and even catch a movie. Don’t judge: it was a much-needed breather before diving back into the tech-filled hustle and bustle of the Summit.

**The Food?** Uhm, not as great as the previous year’s summit, I did munch on a lot of doughnuts though. Despite the crowd (or maybe because of it), the AWS Summit Johannesburg had so much to offer. Here’s why events like this are worth attending:

### Networking With The Best Minds

You get to meet and connect with industry leaders, AWS experts, and peers who are tackling similar challenges. From casual conversations to deep technical discussions, there’s an opportunity to learn from every interaction.

### Hands-On Learning

Workshops and labs let you dive into AWS services directly. Whether you’re curious about machine learning, security, or cloud migration, there’s something for everyone to _do_, not just _hear about_.

### A Platform for African Innovation

It was inspiring to see Africans and the diaspora share how they’re leveraging AWS to create solutions uniquely tailored to the continent’s challenges. The Summit highlighted our resilience, creativity, and potential to lead on a global scale.

### Inspiration and Ideas

By the end of the day, I walked away with a notebook full of ideas, new ways to solve problems, creative applications of AWS tools, and even personal career goals I wanted to pursue.

### Free Swag and Fun Moments

Let’s be honest: the swag bags, photo booths, and fun activities sprinkled throughout the event added a layer of enjoyment that balanced out the intense learning.

Concluding Remarks
------------------

Attending events like this reminds me why I’m so passionate about the cloud and its potential to reshape Africa’s future. And yes, while sneaking out for a movie might not be on the official benefits list, it’s proof that you can have a bit of balance during jam-packed tech events! Would I go again? Absolutely.
